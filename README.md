# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### How it works: 

Once opened in browser in any screen size, user sees a text field and a disabled favorites icon. When user types in this text field, he sees the results in the list below where he/she can make an item favorite by clicking favorite button against every item.
When at least one item is marked as favorite, the button is enabled and favorite list can be visualized by clicking this enabled button. From here, user can filter by adding input to the text field present in the modal and also, remove item(s) from this list as well.
